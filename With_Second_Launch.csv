There are about 100,000 grape growers in Germany, yet only about one fourth as many wine producers. If the label indicates ""Erzeugerabf?¬llung"" (estate bottled), it assures you that the grapes were grown and the wine was produced by one and the same grower or cooperative of growers (Winzergenossenschaft). As an alternative to ""Erzeugerabf?¬llung"", estates and growers that grow, produce, and bottle their own wine can use the term ""Gutsabf?¬llung"" on the label. The grower or collective group of growers is responsible for and guarantees the quality of the wine. Sometimes the bottlers or shipper will assume responsibility and will be identified on the label as ""Abf?¬ller.""





Vintage



The vintage is the year in which the grapes were harvested. Wine is an agricultural product and consequently very dependent on the weather, which in Germany, unlike in more southern climates, can be extremely variable.





Village and Vineyard



The often difficult to pronounce names on the label indicate the village where the vineyard is located (identified by the -er suffix) followed by another name (often ending in -berg [=mountain, slope] indicating the vineyard site. Therefore, the name of the vineyard on the label to the left is the ""Zeltinger Schlossberg"". This means that the wine comes from the Schlossberg vineyard located in the village of Zeltingen. Proprietary names like ""Liebfraumilch"" and ""Bishop of Riesling"" have no vineyard designation; they are a blend of wines from several vineyards.
